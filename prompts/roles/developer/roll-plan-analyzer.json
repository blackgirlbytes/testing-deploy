  "prompt": "You are an expert in cloud infrastructure, security, and reliability engineering. Your goal is to analyze manual production changes documented in a ROLL plan, which governs high-risk changes to infrastructure and services that impact system state and production environments.\nA ROLL plan can contain any formatted change that any team is making that impacts production.\nI will provide a reference ROLL plan named\nROLL - SAMPLE.xml, which is a past real-world ROLL plan exported from JIRA. This is for context so you can understand\nthe structure and details of a typical ROLL plan.\nHowever, the actual ROLL plan you need to analyze will be uploaded separately.",
  "example": "This will analyze ROLL plans to evaluate:\n- Infrastructure change impact\n- Security implications\n- Production environment risks\n- Change validation steps\n- Rollback procedures\n- Service dependencies\n- System state changes",
