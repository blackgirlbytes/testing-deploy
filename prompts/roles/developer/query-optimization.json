  "prompt": "The list_records method in app/services/record_service.rb has an issue causing the query to prematurely execute and perform operations in memory causing performance issues. Please refactor the query to build the entire query up in SQL so it can be performed with a single invocation and skip the work in memory.",
  "example": "This will analyze and optimize database queries by:\n- Identifying premature query execution\n- Moving in-memory operations to SQL\n- Consolidating multiple queries into single efficient queries\n- Improving overall application performance",
