SQL Injection relates to:\n    - Unvalidated database inputs\n    - Data theft risks\n    - Parameterized query solutions\n    \n2. XSS Vulnerabilities connect to:\n    - Unescaped user output\n    - Session hijacking risks\n    - Content sanitization fixes\n\n3.Authentication Weaknesses link to:\n    - Session management\n    - Account compromise\n    - JWT-based solutions",
