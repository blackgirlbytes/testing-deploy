First, I'll check the current structure of your spreadsheet\n2. Then I'll create a script to:\n   - Read the full names from Column C\n   - Split each name into first and last components\n   - Keep the first name in Column C\n   - Add the last names in Column D\n3. Finally, I'll save the changes back to your file\n\nPlease provide the path to your Excel file and I'll help you split the names.",
