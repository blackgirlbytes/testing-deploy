  "prompt": "I'm presenting our quarterly sales data and customer metrics to a restaurant merchant. What questions should I be asking their team?",
  "example": "Using sample restaurant data:\n- Monthly revenue: $120,000\n- Average order value: $35\n- Customer repeat rate: 45%\n- Peak hours: 12-2pm, 6-8pm\n\nThis will generate strategic questions like:\n- With 45% of customers returning, what initiatives could increase our repeat customer rate?\n- How can we increase sales during non-peak hours?\n- What menu items drive the highest margins?\n- Which delivery platforms are most profitable for us?\n- How does our average order value compare to similar restaurants in the area?",
